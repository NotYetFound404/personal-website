<h1 id="who-am-i"><strong>Who am I?</strong></h1>
<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Cesar Garcia, a final-year finance student interning at Moody&rsquo;s Local PE. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, learning new <em>thingsâ„¢</em>, and understanding different perspectives. Currently, I&rsquo;m focused on coding and preparing for the CFA and FRM.</p>
<h1 id="what-have-i-done"><strong>What have I done?</strong></h1>
<p>Succintly: thought, explored, learned, and adapted.</p>
<h1 id="how-can-i-help-you"><strong>How can I help you?</strong></h1>
<p>My experience has helped me develop skills to tackle issues related credit risk, data analysis, and corporate finance. Being at an early stage in my career, however, I&rsquo;m still learning.</p>
<p>Although, I&rsquo;m quite a fan of tackling new challenges that make me ponder and think about them in different ways.</p>
<h1 id="whats-this-all-about"><strong>What&rsquo;s this all about?</strong></h1>
<p>To be completely honest, this is both an initiative to showcase all that I&rsquo;ve learned throughout the years (ðŸ¤« something something professionalism and skill signaling ðŸ¤«) and a personal hubspot for creating technical concepts (inspired by Tiago Forte&rsquo;s Second Brain).</p>
<p>But, as in life, not everything is about the &lsquo;boring&rsquo; serious work. I&rsquo;m a firm believer in balance and exploring new things that interest me. So, I&rsquo;ll also be writing some articles and rambles about topics I come across!</p>
