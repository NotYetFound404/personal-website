# **Who am I?**  
Hi! I'm Cesar Garcia, a final-year finance student interning at Moody's Local PE. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, learning new _thingsâ„¢_, and understanding different perspectives. Currently, I'm focused on coding and preparing for the CFA and FRM.

# **What have I done?**  
Succintly: thought, explored, learned, and adapted.

# **How can I help you?**  
My experience has helped me develop skills to tackle issues related credit risk, data analysis, and corporate finance. Being at an early stage in my career, however, I'm still learning.

Although, I'm quite a fan of tackling new challenges that make me ponder and think about them in different ways.

# **What's this all about?**  
To be completely honest, this is both an initiative to showcase all that I've learned throughout the years (ðŸ¤« something something professionalism and skill signaling ðŸ¤«) and a personal hubspot for creating technical concepts (inspired by Tiago Forte's Second Brain).

But, as in life, not everything is about the 'boring' serious work. I'm a firm believer in balance and exploring new things that interest me. So, I'll also be writing some articles and rambles about topics I come across!
